## 📚 Loan Default Prediction Using Machine Learning Algorithms

Predicting loan defaults is crucial for financial institutions to mitigate risk and enhance decision-making. The report compares five machine learning algorithms namely **Logistic Regression**, **Decision Trees**, **Random Forest**, **XGBoost**, and **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)** to predict loan default risk.

Key data preprocessing steps include **feature engineering**, **label encoding**, and **hyperparameter tuning** using `RandomizedSearchCV`. Model performance was evaluated using **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, **F1 score**, and **AUC**. Among all models, **Random Forest**, **XGBoost**, and **ANN** outperformed Logistic Regression and Decision Trees across all metrics. The results are also compared with existing studies, highlighting the importance of model selection and optimization in predictive finance.
